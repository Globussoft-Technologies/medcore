/**
 * Tenant-scoped Prisma client.
 *
 * Wraps the shared `prisma` singleton exported from `@medcore/db` with a
 * `$extends({ query: … })` block that automatically injects `tenantId` on
 * `create` and automatically filters by `tenantId` on read/update/delete
 * operations for the set of tenant-scoped models listed in
 * {@link TENANT_SCOPED_MODELS}.
 *
 * The tenant id comes from the per-request `AsyncLocalStorage` populated by
 * `withTenantContext` (see `./tenant-context.ts`). When no tenant is in
 * scope — for example during the initial admin bootstrap, migrations, a
 * cron job running outside of an HTTP request, or support-engineer
 * cross-tenant admin tooling — the extension behaves as a pass-through,
 * letting the caller see/modify rows across every tenant.
 *
 * Callers should `import { tenantScopedPrisma } from ".../services/tenant-prisma"`
 * going forward. The un-scoped `prisma` export remains available for the
 * parts of the codebase that are still being migrated and for admin-console
 * and migration scripts that explicitly need cross-tenant reach.
 */

 * Models whose rows are owned by exactly one tenant. Keep this list in sync

 * MUST be added here or the extension will not scope it.
 *
 * Models NOT in this set (e.g. `Icd10Code`, `Medicine` catalog, system
 * config, ABDM/FHIR/insurance artefacts, AI reference data) are
 * intentionally cross-tenant and fall through the extension untouched.
